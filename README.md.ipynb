It supports **UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger** by helping farmers and policymakers make data-driven decisions for food production.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Objective\r\nDesign a machine learning model that predicts crop yield from input features like soil quality and rainfall. This contributes to global food security and sustainable farming practices.\r\n\r\n## 🧠 ML Concept\r\n- Supervised Learning (Week 2 concept)\r\n- Linear Regression Model\r\n- Evaluation using MAE and R² Score\r\n\r\n## 📊 Dataset\r\nA synthetic dataset simulating agricultural conditions:\r\n- Feature1: Soil Quality Index\r\n- Feature2: Rainfall (or similar)\r\n- Yield: Crop output (target)\r\n\r\n## 🛠️ Tools\r\n- Python\r\n- Jupyter Notebook\r\n- Pandas, Scikit-learn\r\n- Matplotlib / Seaborn\r\n\r\n## 🧪 Results\r\n- Model accurately predicts yield trends.\r\n- Evaluation metrics show effectiveness in simulating real-world crop patterns.\r\n\r\n## 📷 Screenshots\r\nInclude at least 2:\r\n1. Model training and prediction plot  \r\n2. Evaluation metrics / printed results  \r\n\r\n*(Take screenshots from your Jupyter Notebook and upload them here using the GitHub \"drag and drop\" feature.)*\r\n\r\n## 🚀 How to Run\r\n1. Clone this repo\r\n2. Open the Jupyter notebook\r\n3. Run all cells\r\n\r\n## 📜 License\r\nOpen source for educational purposes.\r\n","metadata":{}}]}
