# SDG2-Crop-Yield-Predictor
ML project for SDG 2: Predicting crop yield using regression
# 🌾 Predicting Crop Yields with Machine Learning – SDG 2: Zero Hunger

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **supervised learning** (regression) to predict crop yields based on agricultural inputs. It supports **UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger** by helping farmers and policymakers make data-driven decisions for food production.

## 🎯 Objective
Design a machine learning model that predicts crop yield from input features like soil quality and rainfall. This contributes to global food security and sustainable farming practices.

## 🧠 ML Concept
- Supervised Learning (Week 2 concept)
- Linear Regression Model
- Evaluation using MAE and R² Score

## 📊 Dataset
A synthetic dataset simulating agricultural conditions:
- Feature1: Soil Quality Index
- Feature2: Rainfall (or similar)
- Yield: Crop output (target)

## 🛠️ Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🧪 Results
- Model accurately predicts yield trends.
- Evaluation metrics show effectiveness in simulating real-world crop patterns.
